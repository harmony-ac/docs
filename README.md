# Overview

## What is Harmony?

Harmony is a powerful GUI test design and automation tool specifically designed for testing web applications. It streamlines the entire testing process by separating the test design phase from the test automation phase, making it easier for users to create and maintain efficient test suites.

With Harmony, you can design tests in high-level steps, each comprising a human-readable action and its corresponding human-readable response. Furthermore, tests can include a test state, describing the application's condition after executing a step. This approach makes test cases highly readable and maintainable, ensuring seamless collaboration among team members.

## Why Use Harmony? - The Key Benefits

Harmony offers several compelling benefits that make it stand out from other test automation tools:

1. **Clear Separation of Test Design and Automation**: Harmony's unique approach separates the test design phase from the test automation phase, making it easier to plan and structure your tests logically.
2. **High-Level Test Design**: Design tests in a simple, human-readable format with actionable steps and responses. This approach ensures better understanding and collaboration among team members, even those with limited technical expertise.
3. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Test Suites**: Harmony provides tools to reduce redundancy in test cases. You can fork test cases and utilize preconditions to make your test suite more efficient and easier to maintain.
4. **Cloud-Based with Local Runner**: Harmony is a cloud-based application, but for automation and test execution, you run a local runner via npx. This setup offers the flexibility of cloud-based management and the reliability of running tests locally.

## The Harmony Method

Harmony follows a systematic approach to streamline the entire testing process. Let's walk through the key phases:

1. **Specifying Requirements**: Before creating tests, you need to define the requirements and expectations for your web application. This step lays the foundation for creating effective tests.
2. **Designing Tests**: In the test design phase, you'll compose tests using high-level steps, actions, responses, and test states. Harmony's tools allow you to make your test suite DRY by utilizing forking and preconditions.
3. **Automating Actions and Responses**: After designing tests, you move on to test automation. In this phase, you'll record the actions and responses within the embedded browser to generate a fully automated test suite.
4. **Running Tests**: With the test automation in place, you can run your tests using the local runner. Harmony provides various options for managing test statuses and environments.
5. **Maintaining Tests**: As your application evolves, you might need to update your tests. Harmony makes test maintenance efficient by clearly separating test design from automation, allowing easier modifications.

Throughout this documentation, we'll guide you through each step of the Harmony Method, ensuring you can harness the full potential of this powerful testing tool.
